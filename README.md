Our web app provides all the information about the upcoming, ongoing and past events in IITD community as well as we can update our database to make it accessible to all IIT's and NIT's, because it is problem faced by all IIT students because the number of events is very high and they are unable to update themselves even about the events important to them. 
Our web app helps by giving personalised recommendations according to their preferences. 
Also they can apply different filters to get details about the event they are interested in.
Also, They can simply write the description of any event in the search box and get the relevant event details.
These details include Date & Time of the event, location , and organiser of the event and also a general description about the event.
